My review of knowledge graph-related papers from EMNLP 2019.
[Part I](https://medium.com/@mgalkin/knowledge-graphs-nlp-emnlp-2019-part-i-e4e69fd7957c) is about language models, extracting KGs from text, dialogue systems, and KG embeddings.


[Part II](https://medium.com/@mgalkin/knowledge-graphs-nlp-emnlp-2019-part-ii-56f5b03ad9ba) discusses question answering, natural language generation from KGs, commonsense reasoning, and NER & RL.
