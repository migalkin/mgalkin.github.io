A new paper [Neural graph reasoning: Complex logical query answering meets graph databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14617) and an accompanying [Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-graph-databases-cc35c9e1d04f) where we introduce the concept of Neural Graph Databases (NGDB) and a whole new categorization of complex logical query answering tasks. NGDBs answer complex queries right in the latent space and are able to reason over missing links ("what's missing?") in addition to standard DB-like retrieval ("what's there"?).
