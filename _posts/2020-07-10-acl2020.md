The anniversary [post](https://medium.com/@mgalkin/knowledge-graphs-in-natural-language-processing-acl-2020-ebb1f0a6e0b1) is the series of KG-related papers. It's been one year since I started publising such digests, and we're back to the NLP roots and ACL 2020!
This time I focus on question answering, KG embeddings, graph-to-text NLG, some ConvAI and OpenIE.
