A productive week in Singapore! First, gave a keynote at the workshop on [Graph Foundation Models at The WebConf 2024](https://www.www24gfm.com/) and participated in the panel discussion. Then, visited the group of professor [Xavier Bresson](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/xaviercs/) at the National University of Singapore with the talk on graph foundation models - from KG reasoning to AI 4 Science. Thank you Professor Bresson for extending the invitation! [Slides](/files/2024/NUS_Talk_slides.pdf)
