In a new [Medium post](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/graph-ml-in-2023-the-state-of-affairs-1ba920cb9232), we provide an overview of whatâ€™s happened in Graph ML in 2022 and its subfields (and hypothesize for potential breakthroughs in 2023), including Generative Models, Physics, PDEs, Graph Transformerrs, Theory, KGs, Algorithmic Reasoning, Hardware, and more!
