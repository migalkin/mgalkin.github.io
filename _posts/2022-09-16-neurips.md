Glad to announce we got three papers accepted at NeurIPS 2022! Two to the main Research track:
* Ladislav Ramp치코ek, **Mikhail Galkin**, Vijay Prakash Dwivedi, Anh Tuan Luu, Guy Wolf, Dominique Beaini. [Recipe for a General, Powerful, Scalable Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12454): GraphGPS, the best graph transformer of 2022!  
* **Mikhail Galkin**, Zhaocheng Zhu, Hongyu Ren, Jian Tang. [Inductive Logical Query Answering in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.08008): for the first time, we propose two approaches for inductive complex query answering over unseen nodes.

And one to the Datasets & Benchmarking Track:
* Vijay Prakash Dwivedi, Ladislav Ramp치코ek, **Mikhail Galkin**, Ali Parviz, Guy Wolf, Anh Tuan Luu, Dominique Beaini. [Long range graph benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.08164): a novel suite of 5 datasets for probing GNNs and GTs on capturing long-range interactions.
