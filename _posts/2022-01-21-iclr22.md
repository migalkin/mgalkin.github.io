Glad to share that we got 2 accepted papers to ICLR 2022! [NodePiece: Compositional and Parameter-Efficient Representations of Large Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12144.pdf) and [Query Embedding on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08166.pdf). Updated pre-prints are coming soon!

See you at ICLR ;)
