Happy to release ULTRA - the first foundation model for knowledge graph reasoning. A single pre-trained ULTRA model is able to do zero-shot link prediction on **any** unseen KG and do so better than many supervisedly trained baselines on 50+ datasets! More details in the [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/ultra-foundation-models-for-knowledge-graph-reasoning-9f8f4a0d7f09). We release the paper, several checkpoints (177k params), code, and data on [GitHub](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/ULTRA) and [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/collections/mgalkin/ultra-65699bb28369400a5827669d).
