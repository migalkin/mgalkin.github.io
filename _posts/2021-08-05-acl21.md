Regular [review](https://towardsdatascience.com/knowledge-graphs-in-natural-language-processing-acl-2021-6cac04f39761) of KG-related papers from ACL 2021, the major NLP research venue in the area. This time: neural databases, retrieval, KG embeddings, entity linking, QA, and a bunch of new datasets.
