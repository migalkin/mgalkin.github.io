I wrote a new [Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/representation-learning-on-rdf-and-lpg-knowledge-graphs-6a92f2660241) about our recent EMNLP 2020 paper ["Message Passing for Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs"](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.596/) where we design graph neural nets for more complex graph structures such as hyper-relational KGs like Wikidata.
