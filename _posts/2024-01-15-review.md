Together with Michael Bronstein, we wrote a huge blog post on the state of affairs in Graph and Geometric DL in 2023 with some predictions for 2024. [Part I](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/graph-geometric-ml-in-2024-where-we-are-and-whats-next-part-i-theory-architectures-3af5d38376e1) focuses on theory and GNN architectures (including graph transformers), [Part II](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/graph-geometric-ml-in-2024-where-we-are-and-whats-next-part-ii-applications-1ed786f7bf63) talks about cool and exciting applications in structured biology, materials science, ML potentials, algorithmic reasoning, and temporal graph learning. We interviewed many prominent researchers to provide several points of view on each subject - so this work wouldn't be possible without the massive community engagement!
