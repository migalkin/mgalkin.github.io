Our paper [Neural-Symbolic Models for Logical Queries on Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10128.pdf) (Zhaocheng Zhu, Mikhail Galkin, Zuobai Zhang, Jian Tang) has been accepted to ICML 2022! In the paper, we introduce **GNN-QE**, a new approach for complex logical query answering based on [NBFNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06935.pdf).
