A [new review on Medium](https://medium.com/mlreview/machine-learning-on-graphs-neurips-2019-875eecd41069) of KG and NLP-related papers from NeurIPS 2019. We'll have a look on novelties in hyperbolic graph embeddings, new KG embeddings with some logic support, new trends in Markov Logic Nets, new goodies from the ConvAI part, and some interesting GNN-related publications.
My review of knowledge graph-related papers from EMNLP 2019.
