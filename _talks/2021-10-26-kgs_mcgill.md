Had a pleasure presenting the introduction to knowledge graphs to the students of the [COMP 599 Network Science course](http://www.reirab.com/Teaching/NS21/index.html) at McGill in the Autumn semester 2021. Thanks [Prof. Reihaney Rabbany](http://www.reirab.com/) for inviting me! [PDF Slides](/files/2021/KG_Lecture_McGill.pdf)
