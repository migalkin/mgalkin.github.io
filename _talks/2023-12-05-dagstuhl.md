I was glad to participate in the [Dagstuhl seminar on Scalable Graph Mining and Learning](https://www.dagstuhl.de/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/23491) in snowy December Dagstuhl together with many other prominent Graph ML researchers and presenting the recent work on graph foundation models.
