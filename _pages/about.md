I am a Research Scientist at Intel Labs in San Diego, CA. Previously a postdoc at Mila in Montreal. I work in the graph representation learning domain on geometric deep learning, GNNs, knowledge graphs, reasoning, and all-things-around Graph ML. I also help to maintain the Telegram channel on Graph ML with all the recent news and paper reviews: https://t.me/graphML. Occasionally, I write posts on [Medium](https://mgalkin.medium.com/) on research papers in Graph ML.
